## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR GOALS (Age 50, Longevity Focus)

### PRIORITIZE (Scores 1-2):
These exercises should form the core of your program. They build muscle and strength with minimal joint stress:
- All band exercises (particularly face pulls, pull-aparts, rows)
- Glute bridges, hip thrusts
- Goblet squats, split squats, reverse lunges
- Single-arm rows
- Push-ups (standard and incline)
- Core stability work (planks, dead bugs, bird dogs)
- RDLs for posterior chain

### USE WITH CARE (Score 3):
Include these but with attention to form, progression, and recovery:
- Bench presses (dumbbells allow natural movement)
- Overhead pressing (monitor shoulder response)
- Romanian deadlifts and rows (maintain neutral spine)

### LIMIT OR MODIFY (Score 4):
These can be effective but have higher injury risk:
- Flies: Use bands instead of dumbbells, or reduce ROM
- Skull crushers: Consider substituting with pushdowns or overhead extensions
- Bench dips: Replace with band work or regular dips
- Nordic curls: Use band assistance; progress very slowly
- Pistol squats: Assisted versions only

### AVOID (Score 5):
At 50, these pose unnecessary risk:
- Jump squats: Use regular squats with progressive loading instead
- Sissy squats: Replace with leg extensions or other quad isolation

### KEY PRINCIPLES FOR JOINT HEALTH:
1. Prioritize bands and cables over free weights for isolation exercises
2. Choose dumbbells over barbells for pressing movements (allows natural movement)
3. Emphasize eccentric control (3-4 second lowering)
4. Include dedicated mobility and stability work
5. Focus on perfect form over progressive overload
6. Include daily: band pull-aparts, face pulls, clamshells
7. Warm up thoroughly before any moderate-impact exercises
8. Listen to your body - persistent joint pain means modify or substitute
